# Story ðŸ“š
Since I wanted to get a better overview of my financial expenses and had the urge to save more I decided that my first flutter app would be a Financial app. 
It has four different pages. **Page 1** visualizes all the expenses. Each expense can be assigned manually to a certain category by the user. Besides, the total amount that is expended in the current month, together with the current montly target is displayed. **Page 2** represents the total amount saved since the usage of the app and a graph that divides this profit over the various months. **Page 3** represents the procentual distribution of expenses over the different categories.

# Technology ðŸ’»
The app is written in Flutter. To pull all my financial bank transactions, the Noridgen API is used. To assure that user adaptations are retained over the different sessions of app usage, transactions are stored on a Firebase.
